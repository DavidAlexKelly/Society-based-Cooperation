        "Above I have defined a simple agent. This agent only needs to be a simple object that holds the values of its group and its wealth in order for my program to work. N number of these agents will be created which are then split evenly into the four societies and have a starting wealth of zero. These agents are all given their own individual neural networks which form the basis of my program and determine the genotypes and phenotypes. \n",
        "\n",
        "The genotypes are represented by the number of neurons in each agent's neural network. Each neural network has the same shape and thus each agent’s genotype is the same. The shape of the neural network is that of 3 input neurons, 6 hidden neurons and 4 output neurons. The three input neurons are needed to take in information about games played. They take in whether or not the agent \"won\" in a game, whether or not the agent was in the same group as its opponent and whether or not the opponent had more wealth than the agent. There needed to be 4 output neurons to represent the four societies the agent could choose to switch to.\n",
        "The number of hidden layer neurons was chosen through research online. From the research i determined that the number of hidden neurons should equal 2/3 of the input nodes plus the output nodes which is of course 6. Through testing having 6 neurons seemed to be ideal to get the results I wanted and to avoid overfitting. So, through all of this I ended up with a 13 number genotype.\n",
        "\n",
        "The phenotypes are the weights of the individual neurons in each agent's neural network. The weights of the neurons ultimately decide if a given agent should swap groups or not. These weights are initially given weights randomly between -1 and 1. Mutation was used in order to evolve the agents and give variance to these weights. This was done by using a gaussian distribution which had a mean of 0 allowing values to be selected from either side of 0. Using a sigma value of 0.2 allows for mutation to be selected within the range of -1 and 1. The independent mutation probability is selected at 0.2. I also employed tournament selection to reduce stochastic noise. It is used to add variance wow still allowing the fittest individuals to pass on. I found using a tournament size of 10 was appropriate as it showed a nice balance of variance and allowing the fittest individuals to pass through. \n"

Over time the other societies sharply fall approaching 0 agents in these societies while all agents move to the buddies society. This makes sense as cooperating gives them the most consistent high rewards and by being in the buddies group they can also make sure they never get zero wealth rewards. This is because unless it’s against its own group it will always not cooperate netting itself at least a point and sometimes six.
